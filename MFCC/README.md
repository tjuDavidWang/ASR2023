# Extraction of MFCC Features from Speech Segments

ASR Homework 1  |  2023/10/15

## Task

Extract acoustic features (MFCC) for a segment of speech. Comment your codes properly.

Submit a report which briefly describes the process of MFCC feature extraction as well as important output figures, such as spectrograms or MFCCs of the speech segment.

 Processing steps include:

- Pre-emphasis
- Windowing
- STFT
- Mel-filter bank
- Log()
- DCT
- Dynamic feature extraction
- Feature transformation

You are allowed to use existing FFT, DCT, and log functions as well as plot functions provided by the package in your project.

For other functions, you have to implement them **by yourself**. The project results must be **original and your own work**. Plagiarism is strictly forbidden.
