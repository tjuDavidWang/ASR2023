# Kaldi

ASR Homework 3  |  2023/12/03

## Task

This task involves three main parts: 

- First, the installation of Kaldi, a popular speech recognition software. 
- Second, running two example projects: yesno and THCHS-30, to test the functionality of Kaldi. 
- Finally, recording a segment of your own speech and recognizing its content using the system trained with the THCHS-30 model. 

The ultimate goal of the task is to report on the entire installation process, the results of running the examples, and the accuracy of your own speech recognition.

## Environment

The experimental setup is hosted on [AutoDL](https://www.autodl.com/home), a computational platform, featuring an RTX 3080 Ti GPU, a 12 vCPU Intel Xeon processor, and 90GB of RAM, running on Ubuntu 20.04, and leveraging CUDA 11.3 for GPU tasks.
